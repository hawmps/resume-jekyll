You can have the best tooling money can buy, but if people are not empowered to use it then you have wasted your money. I love teaching users how to get the most out of tools. I also love to help my colleagues with their challenges, nothing makes life easier than a high performing team! 

<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/trainingslides.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I have created bespoke training courses to target specific users of the Splunk platform. I'm happy doing training sessions one to one or to an audience of hundreds. I can deliver these sessions either in person or remotely depending on the audience. </p>

As a technical lead I have mentored my more junior colleagues on advanced Splunk topics.
