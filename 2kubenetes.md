Due to it's heavy IO load Splunk traditionally has run on "Big Iron", and I have had to manage fleets of physical servers. However containers and microservices are so incredibly useful over the last few years of my career I have been building ancilliary services like heavy forwarder fleets and deployment pipelines using containers. 

I am a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer and can build and deploy applications for kubernetes. Some vendors make this very easy with Helm of course but where practical I can build my own images and manage simple topologies on kubernetes. 
   
Splunk is not an microservice out of the box so it is challenging to fit it into a contemporary Devops workflow. I have created CI/CD pipelines to allow Splunk server, index, and transform configurations to be managed in git and have containerised versions of Splunk run tests against new configurations. 

Most of my cloud expertise comes from working out how to get data into and out of the cloud. I can create simple storage services and compute infrastructure in all three major cloud providers. I have experience configuring AWS Kinesis and Azure Eventhubs as data providers.
