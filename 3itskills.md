Before getting into data engineering I was a Systems Administrator. I was responsible for server administration, database administration, basic website building, security tools management, and more. Managing a large on premise  Splunk environment is almost like running a small data center, where hundreds of bare metal servers need to communicate.  
  
This broad skill base helps me talk to stakeholders across the IT organisation
